    <!-- A brief introduction about myself -->
    <p class="profile">My name is Uche Emmanuel, and I am a software developer with expertise in a wide range of programming languages. I build web, desktop, and mobile applications, and I am passionate about exploring new technologies like blockchain and AI. While I have worked extensively with languages and tools such as C/C++, VB6, VB.Net, Java, C#, PHP, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, and MySQL, my knowledge extends beyond these, as I continually expand my skills in various other technologies.</p>
